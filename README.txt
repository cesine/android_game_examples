To open the project in eclipse, view the screen cast "WATCHME" or do this:
#download the code (git clone https://github.com/cesine/android_game_examples.git )
#in eclipse File>New>Android Project
#if there are no errors, right click on the project name (should be "Home") and choose Run As> Android Application, it will open an emulator, or run your phone/tablet if you've connected it and set it up
#if there are errors they are probably due to the Build Path, or the Android SDK not being installed, or set up properly in the Eclipse Preferences

The "WATCHME" includes a click and point tour of the android basic project structure, where information is found and how you can edit the files to change the behavior. More clear explanation of a basic android project structure can be found in the Android NotePad tutorial: http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/index.html
